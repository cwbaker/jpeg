# JPEG

This is a copy of the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library v9c with support added for building using [Forge](https://github.com/cwbaker/forge).

Changes are made in the *forge-v0.0.x* branch (the default branch for this fork).  These changes will be rebased onto the *master* branch when updating to newer JPEG versions.
